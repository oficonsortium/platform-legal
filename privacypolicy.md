# Open Collective Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 10 October 2025**

<p class="lead">This Privacy Policy covers the Open Collective Platform, accessible through the opencollective.com website and related domains (collectively referred to as "the Platform" or "the Services"), which is operated by OFi Technologies LLC ("OFiTech", "we", "us", or "our"), a company 100% owned and controlled by Open Finance Consortium Inc., a Delaware 501(c)(6) nonprofit corporation (“OFiCo”).</p>

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

## Data Controller

**OFiTech** is the data controller of your personal information. We are responsible for, and determine how your personal data is processed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at info@opencollective.com.

## Collection of Information

### Information You Provide to Us

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, make a payment, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, payment method information and any other information you choose to provide.

### Information We Collect Automatically

When you access or use the Platform, we automatically collect limited technical information necessary for it to function properly and securely. This includes:

- **Essential Cookies and Local Storage**: We use only essential cookies and local storage to operate the Platform. These are required for functions such as maintaining your login session and remembering your language preference. They are not used for analytics, advertising, or tracking.
- **Log Information**: We collect basic log information about your use of the Platform, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to the Platform. This information is used solely for security, debugging, and operational purposes.
- **Error and Performance Data**: Certain technical data (for example, from our hosting or monitoring services) may be collected automatically to detect and fix bugs, ensure platform stability, and protect against misuse.

We do not use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies for analytics, marketing, or cross-site tracking.

### Information We Collect From Other Sources

We may also obtain information from other sources. For example, if you connect your account with an account you have with a third-party service (such as GitHub), we will have access to certain information from that service, such as your profile information, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. Additionally, we may collect information about you from third-party sources that help us to learn more about you, like for example your profile picture or social media handles.

We process your personal information on the following legal bases:

- **Performance of Contract**: Processing your information is necessary to provide the Services to you, such as creating an account, processing contributions, or handling expense reimbursements.
- **Legitimate Interest**: We process your information for our legitimate business interests, such as improving our Services, understanding how our Services are used, preventing fraud, and marketing our Services.
- **Consent**: In some cases, we process your information based on your consent, such as for certain types of marketing communications.
- **Legal Obligation**: We may process your information to comply with our legal obligations, such as maintaining financial records for tax purposes.

## Sharing of Information

We may share information about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:

- With hosts and organizers of a collective, if you are a contributor, or request reimbursement for expenses made in support, of that collective. The collective may use your information for the same purposes and under the same conditions as those outlined in this document. However, it remains solely and exclusively responsible for complying with its legal and declarative obligations in processing your personal data that it carries out by itself, with its own means, and for its own needs. We are only responsible for our use of your personal data, excluding any other uses made by the collective.
- We will share your name and image with GitHub if you participate in a collective that is also working on a software project through GitHub;

If you submit a request to us, we will provide you with a list of the third-party service providers with which we have shared information about you for the 12 months prior to your request;
- In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process;
- If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of **OFiTech** or others;

- With your consent or at your direction;

## Third-Party Service Providers

We work with third-party service providers to perform various operations related to our Services. These providers may have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. Our main third-party service providers include:

- **Stripe, PayPal, Wise**: Payment processors that handle financial transactions. When you make a payment through our platform, your payment information is collected and processed directly by these providers according to their privacy policies.

- **Sentry**: An error monitoring service that helps us identify and fix bugs in our applications. It may collect technical data related to errors encountered while using our Services.

- **Heroku**: A cloud platform service where we host our applications. Your data may be stored on Heroku's servers as part of our service operations.

- **Cloudflare**: A content delivery network and security service that helps us deliver our Services efficiently and securely. Cloudflare may process your IP address and other technical information when you access our Services.

Each of these providers maintains their own privacy policies that govern how they use, store, and process the data they receive. We encourage you to review these policies for more information about their practices.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Specifically:

- Account information is retained for as long as your account remains active, plus a retention period after account closure for legal and accounting purposes
- Financial transaction data is kept for at least 7 years to comply with tax and accounting requirements
- Communication records may be retained for 2 years after your last interaction with us

In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## Social Sharing Features

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools, which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

## Analytics Services Provided by Others

We engage other companies to provide analytics services via the Services. These companies may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by **OFiTech** and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand how our services are being used.

## Security

**OFiTech** takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. These measures include encryption of personal data where appropriate, and regular review of our information collection, storage and processing practices.

## Data Breach Notification

If **OFiTech** becomes aware of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify the competent supervisory authority in accordance with applicable data protection laws. When the breach is likely to result in a high risk to you, we will also notify affected individuals without undue delay.

Our notifications will include, to the extent known at the time, the nature of the breach, the categories and approximate number of affected individuals and records, the likely consequences, and the measures we have taken or propose to take to address the breach.

If the breach does not pose such a risk, we may record it internally without notifying individuals, in line with our legal obligations.

## International Data Transfers

**OFiTech** is based in the United States, and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United Kingdom ("UK"), or Switzerland to the United States or other countries that have not been determined by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, we apply lawful transfer mechanisms designed to protect your personal data.

These safeguards include:
- Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") — We use the European Commission's approved Standard Contractual Clauses, supplemented with additional technical and organizational measures (such as encryption and limited access) to protect your information.
- UK Addendum and Swiss Addendum — For data transfers from the UK and Switzerland, we apply the equivalent contractual clauses recognized by the UK Information Commissioner's Office and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
- Certified Processors — Some of our service providers (such as payment processors and infrastructure vendors) participate in the EU–U.S. Data Privacy Framework ("DPF") or equivalent certification programs, which provide an additional layer of protection when personal data is transferred to the U.S.

By using the Platform or otherwise providing information to us, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred, stored, and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Cookies and Local Storage

We use only essential cookies and local storage to operate the Platform. These technologies are required for functions such as maintaining your login session and remembering your language preference.

We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies for analytics, advertising, or marketing purposes.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject cookies, but this may affect the functionality of the Platform.

Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal where you can indicate your preference regarding tracking and cross-site tracking. Although we do not currently employ technology that recognizes DNT signals, we will only process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Automated Decision Making

We do not use automated decision-making processes that would produce legal effects concerning you or significantly affect you. If in the future we employ such processes, we will provide you with information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and potential consequences of such processing.

Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 18. You must be at least 18 years old to access or use the Platform. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 18.
